# skylanders-portal-reader
Simple Python code that interfaces with the Xbox 360 skylanders portal. So far I've only tested on the first portal, don't know about the rest.

What does this do? 
Well it awakens portal and then adds a custom color transition to it.
Pulsates red if there are no skylanders.
Blue if a skylander is added onto the base.
Waving green if the skylander stays on the base
Red if a skylander is fully removed from the base.

There are some unnecessary waits in it for showcase of what it was before and what it is after.
PS. I'm not that good with python but certainly better than with C++
